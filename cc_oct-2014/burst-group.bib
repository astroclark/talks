  abstract={A very low latency search pipeline has been developed for the LIGO S6 and Virgo VSR2 science runs, targeting signals from coalescing compact binary systems with total mass from 2 to 35 solar masses. The goal of this search is to provide both single-detector triggers and multi-detector coincident triggers with a latency of a few minutes, the former for online detector monitoring and the latter to allow searching for electromagnetic counterparts to possible gravitational wave candidates. The features and current performance of this low latency search pipeline are presented.}

  abstract={We present two search algorithms that implement logarithmic tiling of the time–frequency plane in order to efficiently detect astrophysically unmodelled bursts of gravitational radiation. The first is a straightforward application of the dyadic wavelet transform. The second is a modification of the windowed Fourier transform which tiles the time–frequency plane for a specific Q . In addition, we also demonstrate adaptive whitening by linear prediction, which greatly simplifies our statistical analysis. This is a methodology paper that aims to describe the techniques for identifying significant events as well as the necessary pre-processing that is required in order to improve their performance. For this reason we use simulated LIGO noise in order to illustrate the methods and to present their preliminary performance.}

abstract={The LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) glitch group is part of the LIGO detector characterization effort. It consists of data analysts and detector experts who, during and after science runs, collaborate for a better understanding of noise transients in the detectors. Goals of the glitch group during the fifth LIGO science run (S5) included (1) offline assessment of the detector data quality, with focus on noise transients, (2) veto recommendations for astrophysical analysis and (3) feedback to the commissioning team on anomalies seen in gravitational wave and auxiliary data channels. Other activities included the study of auto-correlation of triggers from burst searches, stationarity of the detector noise and veto studies. The group identified causes for several noise transients that triggered false alarms in the gravitational wave searches; the times of such transients were identified and vetoed from the data generating the LSC astrophysical results.} }

Instrumental glitches and environmental disturbances increase the false alarm rate in the searches for gravitational waves.

	abstract={Soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are thought to be magnetars: neutron stars powered by extreme magnetic fields. These rare objects are characterized by repeated and sometimes spectacular gamma-ray bursts. The burst mechanism might involve crustal fractures and excitation of non-radial modes which would emit gravitational waves (GWs). We present the results of a search for GW bursts from six galactic magnetars that is sensitive to neutron star f -modes, thought to be the most efficient GW emitting oscillatory modes in compact stars. One of them, SGR 0501+4516, is likely ~1 kpc from Earth, an order of magnitude closer than magnetars targeted in previous GW searches. A second, AXP 1E 1547.0–5408, gave a burst with an estimated isotropic energy >10 44 erg which is comparable to the giant flares. We find no evidence of GWs associated with a sample of 1279 electromagnetic triggers from six magnetars occurring between 2006 November and 2009 June, in GW data from the LIGO, Virgo, and GEO600 detectors. Our lowest model-dependent GW emission energy upper limits for band- and time-limited white noise bursts in the detector sensitive band, and for f -mode ringdowns (at 1090 Hz), are 3.0 × 10 44 d 2 1 erg and 1.4 × 10 47 d 2 1 erg, respectively, where ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/734/2/L35/apjl390016ieqn1.gif] {$d_\mathrm{1} = \frac{d_{\mathrm{0501}}}{1\,\mathrm{kpc}}$} and d 0501 is the distance to SGR 0501+4516. These limits on GW emission from f -modes are an order of magnitude lower than any previous, and approach the range of electromagnetic energies seen in SGR giant flares for the first time.}}

  abstract={We present the results of a search for gravitational-wave bursts (GWBs) associated with 137 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that were detected by satellite-based gamma-ray experiments during the fifth LIGO science run and first Virgo science run. The data used in this analysis were collected from 2005 November 4 to 2007 October 1, and most of the GRB triggers were from the Swift satellite. The search uses a coherent network analysis method that takes into account the different locations and orientations of the interferometers at the three LIGO-Virgo sites. We find no evidence for GWB signals associated with this sample of GRBs. Using simulated short-duration (<1 s) waveforms, we set upper limits on the amplitude of gravitational waves associated with each GRB. We also place lower bounds on the distance to each GRB under the assumption of a fixed energy emission in gravitational waves, with a median limit of D ~ 12 Mpc( E iso GW /0.01 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} c 2 ) 1/2 for emission at frequencies around 150 Hz, where the LIGO-Virgo detector network has best sensitivity. We present astrophysical interpretations and implications of these results, and prospects for corresponding searches during future LIGO-Virgo runs.}

  abstract={The first simultaneous operation of the AURIGA detector and the LIGO observatory was an opportunity to explore real data, joint analysis methods between two very different types of gravitational wave detectors: resonant bars and interferometers. This paper describes a coincident gravitational wave burst search, where data from the LIGO interferometers are cross-correlated at the time of AURIGA candidate events to identify coincident transients. The analysis pipeline is tuned with two thresholds, on the signal-to-noise ratio of AURIGA candidate events and on the significance of the cross-correlation test in LIGO. The false alarm rate is estimated by introducing time shifts between data sets and the network detection efficiency is measured by adding simulated gravitational wave signals to the detector output. The simulated waveforms have a significant fraction of power in the narrower AURIGA band. In the absence of a detection, we discuss how to set an upper limit on the rate of gravitational waves and to interpret it according to different source models. Due to the short amount of analyzed data and to the high rate of non-Gaussian transients in the detectors' noise at the time, the relevance of this study is methodological: this was the first joint search for gravitational wave bursts among detectors with such different spectral sensitivity and the first opportunity for the resonant and interferometric communities to unify languages and techniques in the pursuit of their common goal.}}

  abstract={In the framework of the expected association between gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave signals, we present the preliminary results of an analysis aimed to search for bursts of gravitational waves associated with the long GRB 050915a. GRB 050915a was detected by the Swift satellite in 2005, when the Virgo detector was engaged in one of its science runs, namely the C7 run, during which the best sensitivity attained in 2005 was exhibited. This offered the opportunity for the first coincident analysis between a gamma-ray burst and the Virgo gravitational wave detector. Here we give an overview of this ongoing analysis, which at the end will play the role of a prototype, crucial in defining a methodology for gamma-ray burst triggered searches with Virgo. The final results of our analysis will also allow us to evaluate up to which level Virgo will be able to constrain the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal from a typical long gamma-ray burst.}

  abstract={In the framework of the expected association between gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves, we present results of an analysis aimed to search for a burst of gravitational waves in coincidence with gamma-ray burst 050915a. This was a long duration gamma-ray burst detected by Swift during September 2005, when the Virgo gravitational wave detector was engaged in a commissioning run during which the best sensitivity attained in 2005 was exhibited. This offered the opportunity for Virgo's first search for a gravitational wave signal in coincidence with a gamma-ray burst. The result of our study is a set of strain amplitude upper limits, based on the loudest event approach, for different but quite general types of burst signal waveforms. The best upper limit strain amplitudes we obtain are h_{rss}={\\cal O}(10\^{}{-20}) Hz[?]1/2 around [?]200-1500 Hz. These upper limits allow us to evaluate the level up to which Virgo, when reaching nominal sensitivity, will be able to constrain the gravitational wave output associated with a long burst. Moreover, the analysis presented here plays the role of a prototype, crucial in defining a methodology for gamma-ray burst triggered searches with Virgo and opening the way for future joint analyses with LIGO.}

  abstract={The recent observation of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the x-ray light curve of soft gamma-ray repeaters, which fall within LIGO's sensitivity band, prompted us to search for gravitational waves associated with them. We describe the corresponding search algorithm that is based on the energy measurement in a single detector signal stream. We analytically derive the search sensitivity and compare it to the numerical sensitivity provided by the analysis pipeline with simulated detector noise. We found excellent agreement between the two approaches, reassuring us that the analysis method is well understood and implemented properly. The detector noise is approximated as white Gaussian with a strain equivalent spectral noise density of 10 -22 strain Hz -1/2 , similar to the noise floor of the H1 LIGO detector at the time of the SGR 180620 hyperflare event of 27 December 2004. As a trial model, we use a hypothetical 100 Hz QPO lasting for 50s. The corresponding energy sensitivity is found to be E sens = 3.63  10 -43 strain 2 Hz -1 which, in terms of amplitude, is h sens rss-det = 6.06  10 -22 strain Hz -1/2 . We show that, besides being simple and flexible, the algorithm is sensitive to a wide range of waveforms obeying the time and bandwidth requirements.}

  abstract={It is conjectured that cold quark matter with very high baryon density could be in a solid state, and strange stars with low temperatures should thus be solid stars. The speculation could be close to the truth if no peculiar polarization of thermal X-ray emission (as in, e.g., RX J1856) or no gravitational wave in postglitch phases are detected in future advanced facilities or if spin frequencies beyond the critical ones limited by r-mode instability are discovered. The shear modulus of solid quark matter could be \~{}1032 ergs cm-3 if the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations observed are relevant to the eigenvalues of the center star oscillations.}

  abstract={We argue that gravitational instability in the outer parts of collapsar disks may lead to fragmentation near the radius where helium photodisintegrates, because of the strong cooling provided by this process. This physics sets clear physical scales for the fragmentation conditions and the properties of gravitationally bound clumps. Collapse of a fragment proceeds until the neutrons become degenerate; a neutron star of mass [?]0.1-1 M may result. We find that tidal disruption of a fragment and accretion by the central black hole are too rapid to account for the durations of observed X-ray flares from long gamma-ray bursts. Prior to disruption, migration of the fragment is driven by gravitational radiation and disk viscosity, which act together to produce a unique gravitational wave signature. Advanced LIGO may be able to detect such sources within [?]100 Mpc.}

The combination of GW observations with other astrophysical triggers, such as from gamma-ray and X-ray satellites, optical/radio telescopes, and neutrino detectors allows us to decipher science that would otherwise be inaccessible. In this paper, we provide a broad review from the multimessenger perspective of the science reach offered by the third generation interferometric GW detectors and by the Einstein Telescope (ET) in particular. We focus on cosmic transients, and base our estimates on the results obtained by ETs predecessors GEO, LIGO, and Virgo.},

We summarize basic principles of the operation and the design features of the Virgo detector. We present the sensitivity evolution due to a series of intermediate upgrades called Virgo+ which is being completed this year and includes new monolithic suspensions. We describe the present scientific potential of the detector. Finally we discuss the plans for the second generation of the detector, called Advanced Virgo, introducing its new features, the expected sensitivity evolution and the scientific potential.}

  abstract={The goal of the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is to detect and study gravitational waves (GWs) of astrophysical origin. Direct detection of GWs holds the promise of testing general relativity in the strong-field regime, of providing a new probe of exotic objects such as black holes and neutron stars and of uncovering unanticipated new astrophysics. LIGO, a joint Caltech–MIT project supported by the National Science Foundation, operates three multi-kilometer interferometers at two widely separated sites in the United States. These detectors are the result of decades of worldwide technology development, design, construction and commissioning. They are now operating at their design sensitivity, and are sensitive to gravitational wave strains smaller than one part in 10 21 . With this unprecedented sensitivity, the data are being analyzed to detect or place limits on GWs from a variety of potential astrophysical sources.}

  abstract={Sources of gravitational waves are often expected to be observable through several messengers, such as gamma-rays, X-rays, optical, radio, and/or neutrino emission. The simultaneous observation of electromagnetic or neutrino emission with a gravitational-wave signal could be a crucial aspect for the first direct detection of gravitational waves. Furthermore, combining gravitational waves with electromagnetic and neutrino observations will enable the extraction of scientific insight that was hidden from us before. We discuss the method that enables the joint search with the LIGO-Virgo-IceCube-ANTARES global network, as well as its methodology, science reach, and outlook for the next generation of gravitational-wave detectors.}

We describe a model where inflation ends in a different way, due to a very rapid rolling (waterfall) of a scalar field ?? triggered by another scalar field ??. This model looks like a hybrid of chaotic inflation with V(??)=m2??2/2 and the usual theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking with V(??)=1/4??(M2-????2)2. The last stages of inflation in this model are supported not by the inflaton potential V(??) but by the noninflationary potential V(??). Another hybrid model to be discussed here uses some building blocks from extended inflation (Brans-Dicke theory), from new inflation (phase transition due to a nonminimal coupling of the inflaton field to gravity), and from chaotic inflation (the possibility of inflation beginning at large as well as at small ??). In the simplest version of this scenario inflation ends up by slow rolling, thus avoiding the big-bubble problem of extended inflation."

      abstract       = "We present a detailed investigation of chaotic inflation models which feature two scalar fields such that one field (the inflaton) rolls while the other is trapped in a false vacuum state. The false vacuum becomes unstable when the magnitude of the inflaton field falls below some critical value, and a first or second order transition to the true vacuum ensues. Particular attention is paid to the case termed ??????hybrid inflation?????? by Linde, where the false vacuum energy density dominates so that the phase transition signals the end of inflation. We focus mostly on the case of a second order transition, but treat also the first order case and discuss bubble production in that context for the first time. False-vacuum-dominated inflation is dramatically different from the usual true vacuum case, both in its cosmology and in its relation to particle physics. The spectral index of the adiabatic density perturbation originating during inflation can be indistinguishable from 1, or it can be up to ten percent or so higher. The energy scale at the end of inflation can be many orders of magnitude less than the value 1016 GeV, which is ususal in the true vacuum case. Reheating occurs promptly at the end of inflation. Cosmic strings or other topological defects are almost inevitably produced at the end of inflation, and if the inflationary energy scale is near its upper limit they contribute significantly to large scale structure formation and the cosmic microwave background anisotropy.
Turning to particle physics, false vacuum inflaton occurs with the inflaton field far below the Planck scale and is therefore somewhat easier to implement in the context of supergravity than true vacuum chaotic inflation. The smallness of the inflaton mass compared with the inflationary Hubble parameter still presents a difficulty for generic supergravity theories. Remarkably, however, the difficulty can be avoided in a natural way for a class of supergravity models that follow from orbifold compactification of superstrings. This opens up the prospect of a truly realistic superstring-derived theory of inflation. One possibility, which we show to be viable at least in the context of global supersymmetry, is that the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is responsible for the false vacuum."

The general properties of the microwave sky anisotropy in a minimal cosmic string model are calculated, and it is concluded that the line density parameter is less than 10 to the -5th.

In addition, it has been recently suggested that the typical length of newly formed loops may differ by a factor ?????1 from its standard estimate. Here, we analyze the effects of the two parameters p and ?? on the GW signatures of strings. We consider both the GW bursts emitted from cusps of oscillating string loops, which have been suggested as candidate sources for the LIGO/Virgo and LISA interferometers, and the stochastic GW background, which may be detectable by pulsar-timing observations. In both cases we find that previously obtained results are quite robust, at least when the loop sizes are not suppressed by many orders of magnitude relative to the standard scenario.

Here we report limits on the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational-wave background using the data from a two-year science run of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory2 (LIGO). Our result constrains the energy density of the stochastic gravitational-wave background normalized by the critical energy density of the Universe, in the frequency band around 100???Hz, to be <6.9????????10-6 at 95\% confidence. The data rule out models of early Universe evolution with relatively large equation-of-state parameter3, as well as cosmic (super)string models with relatively small string tension4 that are favoured in some string theory models5.

      abstract       = "Using a statistically rigorous analysis method, we place limits on the existence of an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background using pulsar timing observations. We consider backgrounds whose characteristic strain spectra may be described as a power-law dependence with frequency. Such backgrounds include an astrophysical background produced by coalescing supermassive black-hole binary systems and cosmological backgrounds due to relic gravitational waves and cosmic strings. Using the best available data, we obtain an upper limit on the energy density per unit logarithmic frequency interval of ??img1.gif img2.gif h2 ??? 1.9 ?? 10-8 for an astrophysical background that is 5 times more stringent than the earlier limit of 1.1 ?? 10-7 found by Kaspi and colleagues. We also provide limits on a background due to relic gravitational waves and cosmic strings of ??img3.gif img2.gif h2 ??? 2.0 ?? 10-8 and ??img4.gif img2.gif h2 ??? 1.9 ?? 10-8, respectively. All of the quoted upper limits correspond to a 0.1\% false alarm rate together with a 95\% detection rate. We discuss the physical implications of these results and highlight the future possibilities of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project. We find that our current results can (1) constrain the merger rate of supermassive binary black hole systems at high redshift, (2) rule out some relationships between the black hole mass and the galactic halo mass, (3) constrain the rate of expansion in the inflationary era, and (4) provide an upper bound on the dimensionless tension of a cosmic string background."

Indeed, the presence of a series of acoustic peaks is perfectly compatible with a non-negligible topological defect contribution. In such a mixed perturbation model (inflation and topological defects) for the source of primordial fluctuations, the natural prediction is a slightly lower amplitude for the Doppler peaks, a feature shared by many other purely inflationary models. Thus, for the moment, it seems difficult to rule out these models with the current data."

These anisotropies contain information about basic cosmological parameters, particularly the total energy density and curvature of the Universe. Here we report the first images of resolved structure in the microwave background anisotropies over a significant part of the sky. Maps at four frequencies clearly distinguish the microwave background from foreground emission. We compute the angular power spectrum of the microwave background, and find a peak at Legendre multipole lpeak = (197 plusminus 6), with an amplitude DeltaT200 = (69 plusminus 8) microK. This is consistent with that expected for cold dark matter models in a flat (euclidean) Universe, as favoured by standard inflationary models."

Furthermore, due to a different treatment of systematic effects such as underlying stellar absorption, the derived value of the 4He abundance is slightly higher. As a result, the predicted value of the primordial 4He abundance is now in line with calculations from big bang nucleosynthesis when the baryon density determined by WMAP is assumed. Analysis based on prior estimates of the 4He abundance will necessarily lead to constraints which are overly restrictive. Based on this new analysis of 4He, we derive constraints on a host of particle properties which include: limits on the number of relativistic species at the time of BBN (commonly taken to be the limit on neutrino flavors), limits on the variations of fundamental couplings such as ??em and GN, and limits on decaying particles."

Calibration errors are less than 0.5\%, and the low systematic error level is well specified. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is separated from the foregrounds using multifrequency data. The sky maps are consistent with the 7?? FWHM Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) maps. We report more precise, but consistent, dipole and quadrupole values. The CMB anisotropy obeys Gaussian statistics with -58 < fNL < 134 (95\% confidence level [CL]). The 2 ??? ??? ??? 900 anisotropy power spectrum is cosmic-variance-limited for ??? < 354, with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1 per mode to ??? = 658. The temperature-polarization cross-power spectrum reveals both acoustic features and a large-angle correlation from reionization. The optical depth of reionization is ?? = 0.17 ?? 0.04, which implies a reionization epoch of tr = 180img1.gif Myr (95\% CL) after the big bang at a redshift of zr = 20img2.gif (95\% CL) for a range of ionization scenarios. This early reionization is incompatible with the presence of a significant warm dark matter density. A best-fit cosmological model to the CMB and other measures of large-scale structure works remarkably well with only a few parameters. The age of the best-fit universe is t0 = 13.7 ?? 0.2 Gyr. Decoupling was tdec = 379img3.gif kyr after the big bang at a redshift of zdec = 1089 ?? 1. The thickness of the decoupling surface was ??zdec = 195 ?? 2. The matter density of the universe is ??mh2 = 0.135img4.gif, the baryon density is ??bh2 = 0.0224 ?? 0.0009, and the total mass-energy of the universe is ??tot = 1.02 ?? 0.02. It appears that there may be progressively less fluctuation power on smaller scales, from WMAP to fine-scale CMB measurements to galaxies and finally to the Ly?? forest. This may be accounted for with a running spectral index of scalar fluctuations, fitted as ns = 0.93 ?? 0.03 at wavenumber k0 = 0.05 Mpc-1 (???eff ??? 700), with a slope of dns/d ln k = -0.031img5.gif in the best-fit model. (For WMAP data alone, ns = 0.99 ?? 0.04.) This flat universe model is composed of 4.4\% baryons, 22\% dark matter, and 73\% dark energy. The dark energy equation of state is limited to w < -0.78 (95\% CL). Inflation theory is supported with ns ??? 1, ??tot ??? 1, Gaussian random phases of the CMB anisotropy, and superhorizon fluctuations implied by the temperature-polarization anticorrelations at decoupling. An admixture of isocurvature modes does not improve the fit. The tensor-to-scalar ratio is r(k0 = 0.002 Mpc-1) < 0.90 (95\% CL). The lack of CMB fluctuation power on the largest angular scales reported by COBE and confirmed by WMAP is intriguing. WMAP continues to operate, so results will improve."

Because of differing interferometer configurations with respect to S5, much effort has been invested understanding new sources of noise in the LIGO S6 interferometers. The LIGO Scientific Collaboration's detector characterization working group is actively investigating the origin of noise in the LIGO interferometers and determining the periods of good, bad or questionable data quality. We describe the instrumental issues found to affect the data quality in S6 and the vetoes developed for burst and inspiral searches. The methods used to search for and identify periodic noise lines are also presented. A summary of other noise search efforts in S6 is also given."
